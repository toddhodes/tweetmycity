        <p>TweetMyCity is not interested in retaining your private information, other than to provide the TweetMyCity service to you. Use of TweetMyCity is entirely voluntary. If you aren't comfortable with any part of this privacy policy, simply discontinue use of the service.</p>

        <p>In order to post on your behalf to Twitter, you must give TweetMyCity your Twitter login credentials. TweetMyCity only stores your credentials for purposes of posting on your behalf as explained on this site. You may also give your device a nickname. Anything you supply in this free response form may be posted on your behalf to Twitter, a public forum not controlled by TweetMyCity. Any personally identifying information included in this nickname can no longer be considered private.</p>

        <p>In order to detect when you arrive in a new city, TweetMyCity follows your phone's location using the Veriplace Location Platform. TweetMyCity doesn't obtain your mobile phone number or other carrier information. TweetMyCity simply asks Veriplace for your geographic location. TweetMyCity stores a limited amount of your location information for purposes of detecting when you arrive in a city you weren't in previously. TweetMyCity is not interested in long term storage of your location or any sort of fine-grained tracking.</p>

        <p>TweetMyCity exists to post your city-level location information to Twitter, a public forum not controlled by TweetMyCity. By using this application, you're acknowledging that this basic location information -- including your approximate time of arrival in each city -- can no longer be considered private.</p>

        <p>If at any time you'd like to discontinue use of TweetMyCity, sign in to your Veriplace account at Veriplace.com. There you will be able to revoke TweetMyCity's access to your location. Once revoked, TweetMyCity will drop all of your Twitter account information, location information, and any personally identifying information.</p>
