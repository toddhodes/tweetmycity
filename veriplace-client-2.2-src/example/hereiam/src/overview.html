<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p>
<b>Here I Am</b> is a simple Java servlet-based web application that demonstrates
the basic user discovery and location APIs of the
<a href="http://developer.veriplace.com/devportal/developerguide/about.html">Veriplace
location platform</a>.  The application gives each user a free trial period to make
a limited number of location requests.  The user may be accessing the application
through a browser on a mobile device, and requesting the location of that device;
or, if using a desktop web browser, the user can locate a device somewhere else
that has been registered with Veriplace by logging in with a mobile number and
password.
</p>

<p>
The flow is as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Home page:  user clicks a form button. </li>
<li> Application uses the OAuth protocol to detect whether the user is
     currently identifiable by Veriplace, i.e. is accessing the application
     through a Veriplace-enabled mobile device or a web browser that has
     already logged into Veriplace.  If so, skip to step 4. </li>
<li> Application displays a page explaining that the user will now be asked to
     log in or register their mobile device.  The user is then redirected to
     the Veriplace site to do this, and provides the mobile number to Veriplace
     only - the application receives only an opaque identifier.  If this user
     has not previously granted permission for this particular application to
     get their location, Veriplace also asks for this permission (which the
     user can restrict or revoke at any time). </li>
<li> Application checks its own internal list of users to see if this user has
     exceeded the maximum number of location requests or the free trial period. </li>
<li> Application asks Veriplace for the user's location.  It uses two request
     modes:  if Veriplace already has a recent location for this user (which is
     usually the case with smartphones), the application can receive it quickly
     without being billed for the request; otherwise it makes a request for a
     new on-demand location, which is billable.  (However, you can always try
     this demo without incurring charges by using one of the simulated test
     phone numbers provided on the Veriplace Developer Portal.) </li>
<li> Application displays a result page showing the current location. </li>
</ol>

<p>
A somewhat fancier-looking but functionally identical version of Here I Am is
publicly accessible at <a href="http://demo.veriplace.com/">http://demo.veriplace.com/</a>.
For this source code distribution, we've removed nonessential parts of the
application to make it clearer and more portable:
</p>

<ul>
<li> It stores the list of users in memory rather than in a database, so it
     will forget them if the application server is restarted. </li>
<li> It does not include the JavaScript code to create a live map (as can be
     done with various free web services), but simply shows the street address
     and/or latitude-longitude coordinates. </li>
</ul>

<h2>
Building
</h2>

<p>
To build and deploy this application, you need <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/index.jsp">JDK</a>
1.5 or higher, <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> 1.7, and a servlet
container such as <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a>.
</p>

<p>
Run <tt>ant</tt> to build the application.  This compiles the Java code and
creates a web archive (<tt>.war</tt>) file in the <tt>build/lib</tt> directory.
It also generates HTML <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/">Javadoc</a>
documentation in <tt>build/doc</tt> which you can use as an overview of the
source code.
</p>

<h2>
Configuring
</h2>

<p>
Before deploying the web archive to your servlet container, you'll need to
provide a configuration file containing Veriplace application credentials
(consumer key and secret).  You get these by creating a free <a
href="http://developer.veriplace.com/devportal/developerguide/getting-started.html">developer
account</a> on the Veriplace Developer Portal, where you also provide the
application information that the user will see when interacting with Veriplace.
Unless and until you submit the application for certification by Veriplace,
you will only be able to locate a limited number of real phones of your
choice, as well as virtual users with simulated location data for testing.
</p>

<p>
The application expects the file to be called <tt>hereiam.properties</tt>, and
looks for it in a location that's defined in <tt>build.xml</tt> in the
property <bb>app.properties.path</bb>; the default location is <tt>/tmp</tt>.
There's a sample version of the file in this distribution, showing the format
of the parameters.  Copy your application's credentials into it and put it in
<tt>/tmp</tt> or wherever you'd like it to be.

<h2>
Implementation Notes
</h2>

<p>
The application consists of four Java servlet classes defining the behavior of
its main pages; a simple data structure to keep track of the list of users and
their trial periods; and a set of <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">Java
Server Pages</a> which it uses as templates for the HTML output.
</p>

<p>
Using the Web Tier of our Client API, the application interacts with the
Veriplace platform as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li> (in <a href="com/veriplace/demo/web/StartPage.html">StartPage.java</a>)
     makes a non-interactive <a
     href="http://developer.veriplace.com/devportal/developerguide/user-api.html">user
     discovery</a> request, to determine whether Veriplace already knows who the
     current user is; </li>
<li> (in <a href="com/veriplace/demo/web/LoginPage.html">LoginPage.java</a>) if
     necessary, makes an interactive user discovery request, to let the user
     log in or register with Veriplace; </li>
<li> (in <a href="com/veriplace/demo/web/LocatePage.html">LocatePage.java</a>) makes
     a <a href="http://developer.veriplace.com/devportal/developerguide/location-api.html">location
     authorization request</a>, to confirm that the application may locate the
     user - asking for permission interactively only if it was not already granted;</li>
<li> (in <a href="com/veriplace/demo/web/LocatePage.html">LocatePage.java</a>)
     makes a "freedom mode" location request, which can obtain a recent location
     quickly (and free of charge) in many cases, especially if the user has a
     smartphone; </li>
<li> (in <a href="com/veriplace/demo/web/LocatePage.html">LocatePage.java</a>)
     if such a location wasn't available, makes a "zoom mode" location request,
     which contacts the user's phone to get a new location. </li>
</ol>

<p>
Steps 1, 2, and 3 use an authorization process - based on the <a href="http://oauth.net">OAuth</a>
1.0A protocol - that involves redirecting the user's browser to the Veriplace site,
then redirecting back to the previously active page on your site once an access
token is obtained.  Thus, each of these servlets will be called at least twice:
first leading up to the point where it makes the authorization request and is
redirected, and then again when it comes back from the redirect.  This process
is handled transparently by the Web Tier, so that in each case the application
can just call a single method that means "start the request, redirect and exit;
or, if we were already redirected, get the result of the request and continue."
Similarly, the Web Tier takes care of displaying an auto-refreshing "please
wait" page during the location request in step 5.
</p>

<p>
This is not the only way to use the Veriplace APIs; it's just the simplest way
to add the authorization and location request steps to a typical form-based web
application, if you want to delegate those steps to the Veriplace site.  Other
kinds of applications might want to request location access for a phone number
the user has already provided, or to make location requests as part of a
background task rather than during a user interaction.  For these and other
features, see the Veriplace Java SDK API reference in this distribution or at
<a href="http://developer.veriplace.com/docs/java">http://developer.veriplace.com/docs/java</a>.
