Veriplace Here I Am Demo (Source)
---------------------------------

Here I Am is a simple Java servlet-based web application that demonstrates
the basic user discovery and location APIs opf the Veriplace location platform.
The application gives each user a free trial period to make a limited number of
location requests.  The user may be accessing the application through a browser
on a mobile device, and requesting the location of that device; or, if using a
desktop web browser, the user can locate a device somewhere else that has been
registered with Veriplace by logging in with a mobile number and password.

A somewhat fancier-looking but functionally identical version of Here I Am is
publicly accessible at http://demo.veriplace.com/.  For this source code
distribution, we've removed nonessential parts of the application to make it
clearer and more portable, e.g. it keeps data in memory or in the HTTP session
rather than in a database.

Unlike the rest of the SDK examples, this one has its own build script to make
it more self-contained.  To build and deploy, you need JDK 1.5 or higher, Ant
1.7, and a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat.  Run "ant" to build; this
compiles the Java code and creates a web archive (.war) file in the build/lib
directory.  It also generates HTML Javadoc documentation in build/doc which you
can use as an overview of the source code.

More details are in src/overview.html, which also appears in the Javadoc pages.
